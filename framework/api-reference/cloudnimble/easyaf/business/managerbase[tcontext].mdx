public class ManagerBase<TContext>
```

## Inheritance

- [object](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.object)

## Constructors

### ManagerBase

```csharp
public ManagerBase(TContext dataContext, IMessagePublisher messagePublisher)
```

Initializes a new instance of the <xref href="CloudNimble.EasyAF.Business.ManagerBase%601" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> class.

#### Parameters

- **dataContext** ``TContext``: The database context instance for data operations. Should be injected by the DI container.
- **messagePublisher** ``IMessagePublisher``: The message publisher instance for publishing events. Should be injected by the DI container.


## Properties

### DataContext

public TContext DataContext { get; }
```

Gets the database context instance used for data operations.
This context is injected through the constructor and provides access to the database.

It's particularly useful for implementing complex business processes such as user registration, order processing,
or any workflow that needs to coordinate database operations with message publishing for event-driven architectures.
