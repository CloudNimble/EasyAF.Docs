# DelayDispatcher

<Badge variant="outline">Class</Badge>

Provides methods to reduce the number of events that are fired, usually so that rapid,
imperceptible changes are ignored.

## Syntax

```csharp
public class DelayDispatcher : IDisposable
```

## Inheritance

- [object](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.object)

## Implements

- [IDisposable](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.idisposable)

## Properties

### DelayCount

```csharp
public int DelayCount { get; }
```

The number of events that have been dropped in a given interval.

#### Returns

[int](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.int32)

### TimerStarted

```csharp
public DateTime TimerStarted { get; }
```

The <xref href="System.DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> that a new <xref href="System.Timers.Timer" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> was started, in UTC.

#### Returns

[DateTime](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.datetime)


## Methods

### Debounce

```csharp
public void Debounce(int interval, Action<object> action, object param = null)
```

Debounce an event by resetting the event timeout every time the event is 
fired. The behavior is that the Action passed is fired only after events
stop firing for the given timeout period.

Use Debounce when you want events to fire only after events stop firing
after the given interval timeout period.

Wrap the logic you would normally use in your event code into
the  Action you pass to this method to debounce the event.

#### Parameters

- **interval** [int](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.int32): An <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> specifying the <xref href="System.Timers.Timer" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> duration (in milliseconds).
- **action** [Action&lt;object&gt;](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.action-1): The <xref href="System.Action" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> to fire when the <xref href="System.Timers.Timer" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> elapses.
- **param** [object](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.object): Any optional parameters to pass to the <code class="paramref">action</code>.

### Dispose

```csharp
public void Dispose()
```

### Dispose

```csharp
protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
```

#### Parameters

- **disposing** [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.boolean): 

### Throttle

```csharp
public void Throttle(int interval, Action<object> action, object param = null)
```

This method throttles events by allowing only 1 event to fire for the given
timeout period. Only the last event fired is handled - all others are ignored.
Throttle will fire events every timeout ms even if additional events are pending.

Use Throttle where you need to ensure that events fire at given intervals.

#### Parameters

- **interval** [int](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.int32): An <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> specifying the <xref href="System.Timers.Timer" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> duration (in milliseconds).
- **action** [Action&lt;object&gt;](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.action-1): The <xref href="System.Action" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> to fire when the <xref href="System.Timers.Timer" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> elapses.
- **param** [object](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.object): Any optional parameters to pass to the <code class="paramref">action</code>.


## Remarks

<p>
    Throttle() ensures that events are throttled by the interval specified.
    Only the last event in the interval sequence of events fires.
</p>
<p>
    Debounce() fires an event only after the specified interval has passed
    in which no other pending event has fired. Only the last event in the
    sequence is fired.
