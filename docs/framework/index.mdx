# EasyAF Core Framework

The EasyAF Core Framework provides the foundational libraries and abstractions that power the entire EasyAF ecosystem.

## Overview

The Core Framework includes:

- **Base Classes** - Common entity classes, interfaces, and abstractions
- **Dependency Injection** - Extensions and helpers for Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- **Configuration** - Advanced configuration management and validation
- **Data Access** - Repository patterns and data access abstractions
- **Utilities** - Common helpers and extension methods

## Key Features

### Entity Framework Integration
Pre-built base classes for entities with common properties like Id, timestamps, and soft delete support.

### Validation Framework
Comprehensive validation framework that integrates with FluentValidation and DataAnnotations.

### Configuration Management
Type-safe configuration with validation and hot-reload support.

### Logging Extensions
Enhanced logging with structured logging support and performance metrics.

## Getting Started

```csharp
// Add EasyAF Core services
services.AddEasyAF(configuration);

// Use base entity classes
public class Product : EntityBase
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

// Leverage configuration
services.Configure<MyOptions>(configuration.GetSection("MyOptions"));
```

## Architecture

The Core Framework follows SOLID principles and provides:

- Clean separation of concerns
- Testable abstractions
- Extensibility points
- Performance optimizations
