## Remarks

Since unit testing a WebApi should not require knowledge of a *specific* endpoint Url to execute (that's required in *integration* testing),
these constants allow the test to run in a way that abstracts the details of configuring the API away from the developer. That allows the
developer to focus on what is being tested, not on messing with configuration.
