# IMetadataAware

<Badge variant="outline">Interface</Badge>

Defines a message that supports metadata for passing data between handlers in the processing pipeline.

## Syntax

```csharp
public interface IMetadataAware
```

## Properties

### Metadata

```csharp
ConcurrentDictionary<string, object> Metadata { get; set; }
```

Gets or sets the thread-safe metadata storage for passing data between handlers in the processing pipeline.

#### Returns

[ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.concurrent.concurrentdictionary-2)

A <xref href="System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary%602" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> where keys are string identifiers and values are objects
containing the metadata. The dictionary must be thread-safe as it may be accessed concurrently.


## Remarks

Metadata provides a way to attach additional context and data to messages without modifying the core message structure.
This is particularly useful for cross-cutting concerns like tracking, auditing, user context, and handler-to-handler
communication. The metadata survives serialization and can be accessed by any handler in the processing chain.
