# ITrackable

<Badge variant="outline">Interface</Badge>

Defines a message that can track its parent for message lineage and correlation across the processing chain.

## Syntax

```csharp
public interface ITrackable
```

## Properties

### CorrelationId

```csharp
Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }
```

Gets or sets the correlation ID for tracking related messages across the entire processing chain.

#### Returns

[Guid](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.guid)

A <xref href="System.Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> that groups all messages belonging to the same business transaction or workflow.
All related messages should share the same correlation ID regardless of their parent-child relationships.

### ParentId

```csharp
Guid? ParentId { get; set; }
```

Gets or sets the ID of the parent message that triggered this message, enabling message lineage tracking.

#### Returns

[Guid?](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.guid)

A nullable <xref href="System.Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> that identifies the immediate parent message. This value should be null
for root messages that start a new workflow, and set to the parent's ID for derived or spawned messages.


## Remarks

Message tracking enables building a complete audit trail of how messages flow through the system and
which messages are related to each other. This is essential for debugging, monitoring, and understanding
complex business processes that span multiple message types and handlers.

The ParentId property creates a direct parent-child relationship, while CorrelationId groups all related
messages in the same business transaction or workflow, regardless of their hierarchical relationship.
