# AmazonSQSOptions

<Badge variant="outline">Class</Badge>

Defines the configuration options available for SimpleMessageBus queues backed by Amazon SQS.

## Syntax

```csharp
public class AmazonSQSOptions : SQSOptions, IOptionsFormatter
```

## Inheritance

- [object](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.object)
  - `QueuesOptionsBase`
    - `SQSOptions`

## Implements

- `IOptionsFormatter`

## Properties

### CompletedQueueName

```csharp
public string CompletedQueueName { get; set; }
```

Gets or sets the name of the queue to process for completed messages.

#### Returns

[string](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string)

The SQS queue name where successfully processed messages are optionally stored. 
This queue provides an audit trail of completed processing and can be used for analytics or compliance.

### PoisonQueueName

```csharp
public string PoisonQueueName { get; set; }
```

Gets or sets the name of the queue to process for poison messages.

#### Returns

[string](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string)

The SQS queue name where messages that fail processing multiple times are moved.
This queue serves as a dead letter queue for failed message processing.

### QueueName

```csharp
public string QueueName { get; set; }
```

Gets or sets the name of the queue to process for the main messages.

#### Returns

[string](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string)

The primary SQS queue name where messages are published and from which they are consumed for processing.
This is the main message processing queue in the SimpleMessageBus workflow.


## Remarks

This class extends the base SQS options to provide SimpleMessageBus-specific configuration for Amazon SQS queues.
It defines the three-queue pattern used by SimpleMessageBus: a main queue for processing, a poison queue for
failed messages, and an optional completed queue for successfully processed messages.

The SimpleMessageBus Amazon SQS provider follows AWS best practices for message processing and error handling,
including dead letter queues, visibility timeouts, and message retention policies.
