# TestableMessagePublisher

<Badge variant="outline">Class</Badge>

A test double for IMessagePublisher that captures published messages for assertions.
Used in testing scenarios to verify that expected messages were published correctly.

## Syntax

```csharp
public class TestableMessagePublisher : IMessagePublisher
```

## Inheritance

- [object](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.object)

## Implements

- [IMessagePublisher](/api-reference/cloudnimble/simplemessagebus/publish/imessagepublisher)

## Constructors

### TestableMessagePublisher

```csharp
public TestableMessagePublisher()
```

Initializes a new instance of the <xref href="CloudNimble.SimpleMessageBus.Breakdance.TestableMessagePublisher" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> class.
Creates an empty publisher with no published messages or configured actions.


## Properties

### PublishedMessages

```csharp
public IReadOnlyList<IMessage> PublishedMessages { get; }
```

Gets a read-only list of all messages that have been published via this publisher.
This collection can be used in test assertions to verify published message content.

#### Returns

[IReadOnlyList&lt;IMessage&gt;](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ireadonlylist-1)

A read-only list containing all messages published through this publisher in the order they were published.
The collection is empty when the publisher is first created or after <xref href="CloudNimble.SimpleMessageBus.Breakdance.TestableMessagePublisher.ClearMessages" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> is called.


## Methods

### ClearMessages

```csharp
public void ClearMessages()
```

Clears all published messages from the internal collection.
Use this method to reset the state between tests.

### PublishAsync

```csharp
public Task PublishAsync(IMessage message, bool isSystemGenerated = false)
```

Implements the IMessagePublisher interface method by capturing the published message
for later assertion and optionally invoking a configured action.

#### Parameters

- **message** [IMessage](/api-reference/cloudnimble/simplemessagebus/core/imessage): The message to publish.
- **isSystemGenerated** [bool](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.boolean): Indicates whether the message is system-generated.

#### Returns

[Task](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task)

A completed task.

#### Exceptions

- `[Exception](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.exception)`: May throw exceptions if a custom action configured via <xref href="CloudNimble.SimpleMessageBus.Breakdance.TestableMessagePublisher.SetAction(System.Action%7bCloudNimble.SimpleMessageBus.Core.IMessage%2cSystem.Boolean%7d)" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref> throws.

### SetAction

```csharp
public void SetAction(Action<IMessage, bool> onPublish)
```

Sets an action to be executed when a message is published.

#### Parameters

- **onPublish** [Action&lt;IMessage, bool&gt;](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.action-2): The action to execute when PublishAsync is called. 
    The action receives the published message and the isSystemGenerated flag.


## Remarks

The TestableMessagePublisher is designed for unit and integration testing of message publishing scenarios.
It implements the IMessagePublisher interface but instead of sending messages to actual queues, it captures
them in memory for verification. This enables testing of message publishing behavior without requiring
real message queue infrastructure.

Key testing features:
- Captures all published messages for assertion
- Supports configurable actions to simulate publish behavior
- Provides methods to reset state between tests
- Maintains message order for sequence verification

This class is part of the "Breakdance" testing utilities, named after the dance style that emphasizes
breaking conventional patterns - just like how test doubles break the normal execution flow for testing.
