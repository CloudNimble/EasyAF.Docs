# IQueueProcessor

<Badge variant="outline">Interface</Badge>

Defines the contract for queue processing components in the SimpleMessageBus system.

## Syntax

```csharp
public interface IQueueProcessor
```

## Remarks

This interface serves as a marker interface for queue processors, allowing for dependency injection
registration and service discovery. Concrete implementations handle the specifics of reading messages
from different queue providers (Azure, Amazon, FileSystem, etc.) and dispatching them to message handlers.

The interface is intentionally empty to allow maximum flexibility in implementation while providing
a common contract for the dependency injection system.
